    "With digital images or videos computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos and this is where Computer Vision comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of computer vision appears simple because it is trivially solved by people, even very young children. Nevertheless, it largely remains an unsolved problem based both on the limited understanding of biological vision and because of the complexity of vision perception in a dynamic and nearly infinitely varying physical world.\n"

For the longest time, the content of images and video has remained opaque, best described using the meta descriptions provided by the person that uploaded them.\n",
