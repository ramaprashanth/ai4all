    "# Connecting to NAO\n",
    "\n",
    "NAO is an autonomous, programmable humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics, a French robotics company. NAO is the world's leading and most widely used humanoid robot for education, healthcare, and research. NAO is 58cm tall, autonomous, and fully programmable robot that can walk, talk, listen to you, and even recognise your face. NAO has advanced platforms for the in-depth study such as human-machine interaction, cognitive computing and autonomous navigation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "First step of working with the NAO robot involves connecting to it through the internet which can be done either via an ethernet cable or a WiFi connection. However, for convenience we will be connecting to NAO via the WiFi which requires both the NAO and our computer(from which we will be executing the commands) to be on the same network. "
